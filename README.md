# C++ Programming for Financial Engineering

The *"The C++ Programming for Financial Engineering"* Online Course is designed for people interested in pursuing graduated studies in financial engineering and covers essentials C++ topics  with applications to finance.

## Goal

### Basic C/C++ Language and Syntax

Data types, variables, operators and expressions, decisions and loops, functions and storage classes, the preprocessor, pointers and arrays, data aggregates.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

Classes and objects, basic operator overloading, memory management, namespaces.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

Object-oriented modeling, simple inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling.

### Generic Programming in C++ and Standard Template Library (STL)

Introduction to generic programming (GP), template classes in C++, introduction to STL, STL containers and algorithms, combining OOP and GP.

### An Introduction to Boost C++ Libraries

Introduction to Boost, continuous and discrete statistical distribution, random number generator.

### Applications in Computational Finance

Applications and test cases (Black Scholes pricing and Greeks), Monte Carlo methods, finite difference methods (Euler, Crank-Nicolson), lattice methods, exact methods (Barone-Adesi-Whaley, bonds, swaps, swaptions).
