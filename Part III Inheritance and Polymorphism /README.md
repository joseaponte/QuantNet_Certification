# Part III Inheritance and Polymorphism

Generalization/Specialization (ISA) relationship by inheritance mechanism

## Object-Oriented Modeling

> - Gen/Spec (ISA) relationship
> - The Principle of Substitutability
> - When to use ISA and when to use HASA
> - Combining ISA and HASA
> - Good and bad class hierarchies
> - A little UML (Unified Modeling Language)

## Simple Inheritance

> - Inheritance and ISA Relationship
> - Specialisation scenarios
> - Inheritance and object creation
> - Using base class constructors
> - Accessibility of base members
> - Overriding functions

## Polymorphism

> - Pointers to the base class
> - Function visibility
> - Polymorphism
> - Defining an interface
> - Abstract base classes
> - Virtual destructors
> - Operator overloading and inheritance

## Exception Handling

> - Error handling and exceptions
> - Throwing and catching exceptions
> - Exception hierarchy
> - Polymorphic and explicit nets
> - Order of handlers

## Final Remarks and Guidelines

> - Semantic correctness of class hierarchies
> - Efficiency and maintainability issues
> - Too much inheritance considered harmful
> - What to use instead of multiple inheritance
