# Part VI Creating Applications in Computational Finance

Applications for commputational finance

## Applications and Test Cases

> - Black Scholes equation: analytic solution
> - A simple binomial method in C++
> - A one-factor Monte Carlo simulator
> - Using C++ numerical analysis libraries
> - Software design essentials

## Test Case 1 Monte Carlo Method

> - Choose software framework
> - Random number generators
> - SDEs and Finite Difference approximations
> - Performance and accuracy
> - Some 2-factor problems

## Test Case 2 Finite Difference Method

> - One-factor plain options
> - Euler, Crank-Nicolson methods
> - The ADE (Alternating Direction Explicit) method
> - Early exercise features
> - FDM for the CIR pde
> - Comparison of different methods

## Test Case 3 Lattice Methods

> - The one-factor binomial and trinomial methods
> - Two-factor binomial method
> - Early exercise
> - Comparison with FD schemes

## Test Case 4 Exact and quasi-Exact Methods

> - Exact Black Scholes price and greeks
> - Barone-Whaley
> - Noncentral chiSquared distribution
> - Bonds, swaps and swaptions
