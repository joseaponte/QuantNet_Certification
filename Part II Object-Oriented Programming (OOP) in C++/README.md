# Part II Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

> Introduced the object-oriented programming model and how to implemented in C++

## OOP Thinking and Modeling

> - Classes and Objects; what are they?
> - Discovering classes
> - Encapsulation and implementation hiding
> - Class relationships: aggregation and composition
> - Class relationships: inheritance
> - A little UML (Unified Modeling Language)
> - Advantages and disadvantages of OOP
> - OOP in combination with other programming paradigms

## The Class Concept

> - Abstract Data Types
> - Classes and Objects
> - C++ members
> - Constructors and destructors
> - The C++ header file
> - Access specifiers
> - The C++ source file
> - Creating objects

## Improving your Classes

> - Function name overloading
> - Call by reference vs. call by value
> - The 'const' specifier
> - The copy constructor

## Basic Operator Overloading

> - Introduction to operator overloading
> - Binary operators
> - Unary operators
> - Assignment operators
> - The 'this' pointer
> - Returning references
> - The Essential Header File

## Memory Management, Fundamentals

> - Stack, heap and static memory
> - Who takes care of memory?
> - The new and delete operators
> - Dynamic arrays
> - Classes with dynamic memory
> - Smart pointers

## Namespaces

> - Why using namespaces
> - Using classes in a namespace
> - Placing classes in a namespace
> - Nested namespaces
> - Aliases
> - Name lookups
